-The game starts without sound, you can click on the sound on the menu on the top left.
-To move the ship you must increase the ship speed first, or press and hold the up arrow key. Then all other directions will be available once it has speed.
-when paused, you wont have access to any of the buttons except for play and refill missiles (as instructed) 
however if you did want to still be able to build asteroids or any other objects you can click on the overflow on the top right.
-The arrow keys are a bit funky, as it will scroll through the side buttons but if you hold down the arrow key it will slowly begin to move.
-The F key has been initialized to shoot missiles
-To refill missiles on the space station the ship has to be directly on top of it and press F
-I pre-added the blinking space station at a set location from the start, therfore got rid of the Button to create them as only one is needed in game
-Collides will work when they are right on top of each other.
-I apologize, as the Flying Saucer has to be hit directly in the center to be collided with missiles, ship, and asteroids.
-When a object goes to the right, it may take a little longer to come back out from the right. And applies vice versa.
